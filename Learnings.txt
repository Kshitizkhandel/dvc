# Inside DVC- Inside DVC directory . DVC init after commiting the branch to github
DVC init creates .dvc directory and makes changes to the .gitignore file to ensure that 
data is not tracked by dvc

I add data.txt inside raw/data

I do dvc add data/ &
git add data.dvc .gitignore 

This will create a data.dvc file 
outs:
- md5: f365c5c4fe007ddbabe91e6e1661acdf.dir
  size: 27
  nfiles: 5 # Number of files external, interim,processed,raw/ raw/data.txt
  hash: md5
  path: data

  # Understand - Code and .dvc files(registry) are pushed to git but the actual
  data is pushed to cloud , hence the command git add data.dvc .gitignore 

  # Now I will make some changes in data file. Now to keep track of data
  we need dvc to push data to some cloud/temporary storgae so that our local 
  storage does not get too crowded. So we do 
  mkdir tmp
  # dvc remote add -d remote tmp (Here creating tmp as a suod for remote)

  #dvc status
  # dvc push(Pushing the changes to cloud)













# RAM is not equal to cache. Cache is a folder(created for quick access) on
hard disk and not keeping things on RAM
